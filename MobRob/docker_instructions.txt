1. Build ros2-base image
docker build -t ros2-base -f ./docker/Dockerfile.base .

2. Run docker compose to build and start all nodes
docker-compose up --build


Summary of What Happens After Running docker-compose up --build:
Build Images: Docker Compose builds the images for both controller and drive containers based on their respective Dockerfiles.

Start Containers: Docker Compose starts both containers (controller and drive), each with its own environment configuration (volumes, network, devices).

Run Commands: The specified commands (ros2 launch controller my_script_launch.py and ros2 run ariaNode ariaNode -rp /dev/ttyUSB0) are executed inside each container, starting the respective ROS 2 nodes.

Access ROS 2 Nodes: The controller and drive containers are now running, and you can interact with them via ROS 2 commands, check their logs, and troubleshoot if needed.

3. What now?

    1. Access the containers
        docker exec -it <container_name> bash
        Starts a bash session inside containers to check logs, run commands, or inspect the running state.

    2. Monitor ros2 nodes and topics
        ros2 node lost
        ros2 topic list
        ros2 topic echo <topic_name?
